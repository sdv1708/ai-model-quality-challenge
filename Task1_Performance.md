# Task 1 — Performance UI for Customer and Product

## The scenario

Cerebras is known for being fast. Customers care about throughput and gen speed — they want to know, before they commit, whether a model running on us will keep up with their workload.

Today, that answer lives in an `.xlsx` perf projection sheet that only Cerebras perf engineers can read. A customer-facing PM has to open the sheet, decode the column names, and translate the numbers into something the customer can act on. The customer never sees the file directly.

Build the layer that turns those projections into an answer two different audiences can act on:

- **Customer / customer-facing PM** — needs a go/no-go signal: is the model fast enough for the workload they described? What does "fast" look like in numbers they recognize (tok/s, TTFT, context, cost implications)?
- **Internal product / deployment engineer** — needs to sanity-check a projection, see how it shifts with config, and spot anomalies before they reach a customer.

You decide how to serve both audiences. One UI with two views, two separate UIs, or a defended argument for which audience to build for first — all defensible, none obvious.


## The challenge

Build a **tool, not a one-off page**: a UI where anyone can **upload one or more perf
sweeps** — the shipped data, or similar sweeps for models we've never seen — and
immediately get the two audience views below. Uploading **multiple sweeps at once is the
common case**: both audiences need to **compare models side by side** (which is fast
enough? where do they diverge?), so comparison across the uploaded set is a first-class
view, not an afterthought. The sweeps we ship are a sample, not the payload; treat the
file/column shape as the contract and render any conforming sweep. You decide what to
surface for each audience and what the UI looks like.

## Hard requirements

- **Documented launch**. Bringing up the UI should be straightforward from a clean clone. Document your install and launch steps in your README — a reviewer will follow them.
- **Live deployed frontend**. In addition to the source, ship a **publicly reachable URL** where the UI is already running, so a reviewer can click through it without cloning or installing anything. A free host is expected — see [Deploying for free](#deploying-for-free).
- **Upload to render, and compare**. Upload is the core flow, not an add-on. A reviewer must be able to **upload one or many perf sweeps** — a single model's set, or several models at once — and see the views render **live, with no rebuild and no code changes**. When more than one model is uploaded, the UI must let both audiences **compare them against each other**, not just view them one at a time. Parsing happens in the app (client- or server-side); the `Model_<X>_profile_<N>/...xlsx` file-and-column shape is the only contract you can rely on. Pre-loading the shipped sweeps as a sample is fine, but the deployed UI must accept fresh uploads as a first-class path, not a dev-only script.
- **Defensible for a twelfth model**. We will exercise the upload with a brand-new `Model L` (`Model_L_profile_<N>/Model L profile <N>.xlsx`) — a sweep that isn't in the repo — and expect it to render correctly with **zero code edits**. Hard-coded model lists or hand-tuned views that only work for the shipped letters will be marked down.


## Forbidden trivial baselines

These will not pass the rubric. We will check.

- Static HTML dump of the `.xlsx` or a single big table with no audience differentiation.
- A UI that shows every column to every audience and calls it "configurable."
- Hard-coded views or copy that only work for the specific models in `perf_data.zip`.
- "Upload" that really means re-running a build script or editing a config to bake the data in — the deployed UI must ingest uploaded `.xlsx` and render without a rebuild.

## What to submit

Three things.

### 1. Code

A link to (or zip of) your project. Document your install and launch steps in your
README — a reviewer will clone and follow them. Your choice of framework and packaging.

### 2. Live URL

A **publicly reachable link** to the deployed UI. Put it at the top of your README **and
paste it into the submission form** (link in the root README). A reviewer should be able to
open it, **upload one or more perf sweeps, compare them, and get the views** — no cloning
or installing. Hosting on a free tier is fine and expected.

#### Deploying for free

You don't need to pay for hosting. Any of these have a no-cost tier that comfortably
covers this project — pick whichever fits your stack:

- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** — best for React/Next/Vite SPAs; connect the repo and it builds and deploys on push. *(Recommended starting point.)*
- **[Netlify](https://netlify.com)** — same idea, framework-agnostic; drag-and-drop a build folder or connect the repo.
- **[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)** — generous free static hosting with a global edge.
- **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)** — zero extra accounts if your repo is already on GitHub; good for a static build.
- **[Render](https://render.com)** or **[Fly.io](https://fly.io)** — if your UI needs a small backend/server rather than a static bundle.
- **[Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)** or **[Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)** — if you build a Python/Streamlit/Gradio app instead of a JS frontend.

Keep the deployment in sync with the repo, and make sure the link stays live through the
review window.

### 3. Video Explanation (5 min max)
Create a video where you explain
- What problem did you understand yourself to be solving for each audience? What did you cut and why?
- What framework did you pick and what did you rule out?
- What assumptions did you make about the data, the audience, and the deployment context?
- What would change if you had (a) more data, (b) production measurements alongside the projections, (c) more time?
- Based on the performance numbers what size do you think each model A-K represent
- Based on the traffic profile, what do you think are the use case of profile 1-7
